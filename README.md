Using Python programming to classify variables via a correlation map, to find the accuracy of prediction of loan for a customer based on variables. The variables include Loan History,
Loan Amount, Qualification, Income Status and Family Members of the customer. Based on these variables, and the correlation map, data pre-processing was first conducted to eliminate outliers in the dataset.

Once the outliers were removed, EDA was carried out to test which variables can be entered into the Classification Matrix, for the final prediction.
